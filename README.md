Here’s a shorter version that keeps all the concepts:  > Shopping in physical stores often means long queues, crowding, manual billing, and tired customers — plus more staff needed for checkout. > ShopEase solves this by letting shoppers scan or select items, add them to a digital cart, and pay online, skipping queues and easing crowding.
